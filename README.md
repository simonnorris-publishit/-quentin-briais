## Quentin Briais

We would like you to create a page that shows a town with its places of interest to visit.  
Under the places to visit, we need a form for users to submit another place of interest to visit. When the form is submitted, the place of interest is added to the existing list.

The only requirement is that we need Symfony 4 to be used.

We are more interested in the quality of the code and use of best practices than the Integration.

Good luck.
